 0.006 T. R. Wyant
   Fixed problem with 'set corresponding'. Thanks
       to David Jelinek of Central Michigan University
       for diagnosing the problem and finding a
       solution.
   Corrected spelling.
   Eliminated Scalar::Util::looks_like_number, since
       apparently ActivePerl does not have it.
   Add copy() method and autocopy attribute, for getting
       generated puzzles onto the clipboard.
   Add paste() method, for loading puzzles from the
       clipboard.
   Add unload() method.

       -filter option.

   Added generate() method and generation_limit
       attribute.

   Format solution nicely for multi-character symbols.
   Fixed error in values eliminated by a hidden tuple.
   Recoded 'set sudokug' in terms of 'set brick', thus
     fixing an error in generating the small squares.
   Added method add_set(), and recoded 'set sudokux' in
     terms of this and 'set sudokug', thus fixing the
     same error that 'set sudoku' had.
   Put spaces in the result of scalar constraints_used.
   Spiffed up the POD.
