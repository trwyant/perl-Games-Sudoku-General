   Format solution nicely for multi-character symbols.
   Fixed error in values eliminated by a hidden tuple.
   Recoded 'set sudokug' in terms of 'set brick', thus
     fixing an error in generating the small squares.

     terms of this and 'set sudokug', thus fixing the
     same error that 'set sudoku' had.
   Put spaces in the result of scalar constraints_used.
   Spiffed up the POD.
