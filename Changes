 0.012		T. R. Wyant	20-Dec-2011
   Update copy of Gnu GPL in LICENSES/Copying to have current FSF
      address.

 0.011		T. R. Wyant	10-Nov-2011
   No changes from 0.010_90, except for version.

 0.010_90	T. R. Wyant	04-Nov-2011
   'use 5.006002', since that is the oldest Perl I can build.
   Eliminate calls to UNIVERSAL::can as a function.
   Load optional module Win32::Clipboard by file name, mostly so code
      analyzers do not see it as an undeclared dependency.
   Require Test::More for testing.
   Add tests for POD and Perl::Critic, and for file presence and
      executability.
   Author testing is now by the authortest target, which requires
      building via Build.PL. Author testing is no longer supported when
      building via Makefile.PL.
   Moved the modification log from the module POD to the Changes file.
   Revise copyright and license statement.

 0.010		T. R. Wyant	14-Sep-2008
   Fixed Build.PL to heed -y and -n options.

 0.009		T. R. Wyant	21-Jul-2008
   'use 5.006', for 'our' at the very least.
   Update 'SEE ALSO'
   add =head1 LICENSE to POD.

 0.008		T. R. Wyant	09-May-2008
   Tweak docs.
   Support unused cells.
   Add drop_set() method to undo add_set().
   Add 'null' attribute to generate a puzzle with no topology.
   Add 'quincunx' attribute to generate a quincunx (a.k.a.
     'Samurai Sudoku')

 0.007		T. R. Wyant	30-Sep-2006
   Corrected example in topology attribute documentation,
     and other documentation tweaks.
   Moved General.pm to lib/Games/Sudoku.
   Added Build.PL
   In bin/sudokug, added the 'webcmd' pseudo-attribute and fixed the
     'source' command.

 0.006		T. R. Wyant	03-Jul-2006
   Fixed problem with 'set corresponding'. Thanks
       to David Jelinek of Central Michigan University
       for diagnosing the problem and finding a
       solution.
   Corrected spelling.
   Eliminated Scalar::Util::looks_like_number, since
       apparently ActivePerl does not have it.
   Add copy() method and autocopy attribute, for getting
       generated puzzles onto the clipboard.
   Add paste() method, for loading puzzles from the
       clipboard.
   Add unload() method.
   In bin/sudokug, allowed input to be redirected or piped in, and added
       -filter option.

 0.005		T. R. Wyant	20-Dec-2005
   Added generate() method and generation_limit
       attribute.
   Added rows attribute. This changes the default
       output for 'multi-faced' puzzles.

 0.004		T. R. Wyant	16-Dec-2005
   Added Dion cube (via 'set cube number').

 0.003		T. R. Wyant	13-Dec-2005
   Added 'set corresponding' and 'set max_tuple'.
   Added cubic sudoku (via 'set cube').
   Fixed horrendous inefficiency in backtrack logic.

 0.002		T. R. Wyant	11-Dec-2005
   Format solution nicely for multi-character symbols.
   Fixed error in values eliminated by a hidden tuple.
   Recoded 'set sudokug' in terms of 'set brick', thus
     fixing an error in generating the small squares.
   Added method add_set(), and recoded 'set sudokux' in
     terms of this and 'set sudokug', thus fixing the
     same error that 'set sudoku' had.
   Put spaces in the result of scalar constraints_used.
   Spiffed up the POD.

 0.001		T. R. Wyant	09-Dec-2005
   Initial release to CPAN.
