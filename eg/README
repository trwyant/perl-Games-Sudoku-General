This directory contains examples of how to use Games::Sudoku::General.
The following example is provided:

simple
    This is the simplest script I can come up with. It solves a canned
    problem, displaying the problem, the solution, and the constraints
    used.

solver
    This script solves exactly one Sudoku problem, fed to it on standard
    input. The solver object can be configured (within limits) based on
    data parsed out of the input stream. Allowed command qualifiers are
    -demo (to solve a demonstration problem provided via <DATA>) and
    -help (guess what).
