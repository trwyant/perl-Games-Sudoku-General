=head1 NAME

Clipboard - Mock the Clipboard module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use lib qw{ inc/mock };
 
 use Clipboard;
 
 Clipboard->copy( 'We have met the enemy and he is us.' );
 say Clipboard->paste();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl class is private to the C<Games-Sudoku-General> module. It can
be changed or retracted without notice. Documentation is for the benefit
of the author.

This Perl class mocks the CPAN L<Clipboard|Clipboard> module with
sufficient fidelity to test the portion of its functionality used by
C<Games-Sudoku-General>.

=head1 METHODS

This class supports the following public methods:

=head2 copy

 Clipboard->copy( 'Able was I ere I saw Elba.' );

This static method saves its argument, making it available to the
L<paste()|/paste> method.

=head2 import

This method does nothing. It needs to be present because the real
L<Clipboard|Clipboard> module uses it as a hook to determine which
clipboard interface to use.

=head2 paste

 say Clipboard->paste();

This method returns the data from the most-recent call to
L<copy()|/copy>. If C<copy()> has never been called, the return is
undefined.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Clipboard|Clipboard>,
L<Games::Sudoku::General|Games::Sudoku::General>.
