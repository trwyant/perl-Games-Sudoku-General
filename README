Games::Sudoku::General is a module to solve the class of puzzle that
involves allocating symbols among sets such that no set contains more
than one of any symbol. Sudoku is the most common name for such
puzzles, though Number Place and Wasabi have also been used.

Each puzzle is considered to be made up of a number of cells, each of
which is a member of one or more sets, and each of which may contain
exactly one symbol. The contents of a number of cells are gven, and the
problem is to deduce the contents of the rest of the cells.

This module is installable by the usual incantation:

    gunzip Games-Sudoku-General-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf Games-Sudoku-General-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You can skip the gunzip step if your tar allows you to say

    tar -xzf Games-Sudoku-General-9.999.tar.gz

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
General.pm in the Games/Sudoku directory in the appropriate place
in your @INC directories. The executable (bin/sudokug) needs to be
dropped somewhere in your path.

OS-specific notes exist for (at least) MacOS (meaning, Mac OS 9
and lower), MSWin32, and VMS. See the relevant README files for
details.
