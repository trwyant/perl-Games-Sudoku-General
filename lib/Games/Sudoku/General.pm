=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package solves puzzles that involve the allocation of symbols
among a number of sets, such that no set contains more than one of
any symbol. This class of problem includes the puzzles known as
'Sudoku', 'Number Place', and 'Wasabi'.

Each Sudoku puzzle is considered to be made up of a number of cells,
each of which is a member of one or more sets, and each of which may
contain exactly one symbol. The contents of some of the cells are
given, and the problem is to deduce the contents of the rest of the
cells.

Although such puzzles as Sudoku are presented on a square grid, this
package does not assume any particular geometry. Instead, the topology
of the puzzle is defined by the user in terms of a list of the sets
to which each cell belongs. Some topology generators are provided, but
the user has the option of hand-specifying an arbitrary topology.

Even on the standard 9 x 9 Sudoku topology there are variants in which
unspecified cells are constrained in various ways (odd/even, high/low).
Such variants are accommodated by defining named sets of allowed
symbols, and then giving the set name for each unoccupied cell to which
it applies. See L<allowed_symbols|/item_allowed_symbols> for more
information and an example.

This module is able not only to solve a variety of Sudoku-like
puzzles, but to 'explain' how it arrived at its solution. The
steps() method, called after a solution is generated, lists in order
what solution constraints were applied, what cell each constraint
is applied to, and what symbol the cell was constrained to.

Test script t/sudoku.t demonstrates these features. ActivePerl users
will have to download the kit from L<http://www.cpan.org/>  or
L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Games-Sudoku-General/> to get this
file.

=head2 Exported symbols

No symbols are exported by default, but the following things are
available for export:

  Status values exported by the :status tag
    SUDOKU_SUCCESS
      This means what you think it does.
    SUDOKU_NO_SOLUTION
      This means the method exhausted all possible
      soltions without finding one
    SUDOKU_TOO_HARD
      This means the iteration_limit attribute was
      set to a positive number and the solution()
      method hit the limit without finding a solution.

The :all tag is provided for convenience, but it exports the same
symbols as :status.

=head2 Attributes

Games::Sudoku::General objects have the following attributes, which may
normally be accessed by the get() method, and changed by the set()
method.

In parentheses after the name of the attribute is the word "boolean",
"number" or "string", giving the data type of the attribute. Booleans
are interpreted in the Perl sense: undef, 0, and '' are false, and
anything else is true. The parentheses may also contain the words
"read-only" to denote a read-only attribute or "write-only" to denote
a write-only attribute.

In general, the write-only attributes exist as a convenience to the
user, and provide a shorthand way to set a cluster of attributes at
the same time. At the moment all of them are concerned with generating
problem topologies, which are a real pain to specify by hand.

=over

=item allowed_symbols (string)

This attribute names and defines sets of allowed symbols which may
appear in empty cells. The set definitions are whitespace-delimited
and each consists of a string of the form 'name=symbol,symbol...'
where the 'name' is the name of the set, and the symbols are a list
of the symbols valid in a cell to which that set applies.

For example, if you have an odd/even puzzle (i.e. you are given that
at least some of the unoccupied cells are even or odd but not both),
you might want to

 $su->set (allowed_symbols => <<eod);
 o=1,3,5,7,9
 e=2,4,6,8
 eod

and then define the problem like this:

 $su->problem (<<eod);
 1 o e o e e o e 3
 o o e o 6 e o o e
 e e 3 o o 1 o e e
 e 7 o 1 o e e o e
 o e 8 e e o 5 o o
 o e o o e 3 e 4 o
 e o o 8 o o 6 o e
 o o o e 1 e e e o
 6 e e e o o o o 7
 eod

To eliminate an individual allowed symbol set, set it to an empty
string (e.g. $su->set (allowed_symbols => 'o=');). To eliminate all
symbol sets, set the entire attribute to the empty string.

Allowed symbol set names may not conflict with symbol names. If you set
the symbol attribute, all allowed symbol sets are deleted, because
that seemed to be the most expeditious way to enforce this restriction
across a symbol set change.

Because symbol set names must be parsed like symbol names when a
problem is defined, they also affect the need for whitespace on
problem input. See the L<problem()|/item_problem> documentation for
full details.

=item autocopy (boolean)

If true, this attribute causes the generate() method to implicitly call
copy() to copy the generated problem to the clipboard.

This attribute is false by default.

=item brick (string, write-only)

This "virtual" attribute is a convenience, which causes the object to
be configured with a topology of rows, columns, and rectangles. The
value set must be either a comma-separated list of three numbers (e.g.
'3,2,6') or a reference to a list containing three numbers (e.g. [3, 2,
6]). Either way, the numbers represent the horizontal dimension of the
rectangle (in columns), the vertical dimension of the rectangle (in
rows), and the overall size of the puzzle square. For example,

 $su->set (brick => [3, 2, 6])

generates a topology that looks like this

 +-------+-------+
 | x x x | x x x |
 | x x x | x x x |
 +-------+-------+
 | x x x | x x x |
 | x x x | x x x |
 +-------+-------+
 | x x x | x x x |
 | x x x | x x x |
 +-------+-------+

The overall size of the puzzle must be a multiple of both the
horizontal and vertical rectangle size.

Beginning with version 0.005_01, the overall size value is optional,
and defaults to the product of the horizontal and vertical
dimensions. B<Note> that I am B<strongly> considering eliminating this
value, since it appears to me that any value other than the default
results in an impossible puzzle. As of version 0.005_01, specification
of the third value is deprecated. 

Setting this attribute modifies the following "real" attributes:

 columns is set to the size of the big square;
 symbols is set to "." and the numbers "1", "2",
   and so on, up to the size of the big square;
 topology is set to represent the rows,  columns,
   and small squares in the big square, with row
   sets named "r0", "r1", and so on, column sets
   named "c0", "c1", and so on, and small
   rectangle sets named "s0", "s1", and so on for
   historical reasons.

=item columns (number)

This attribute defines the number of columns of data to present in a
line of output when formatting the topology attribute, or the solution
to a puzzle.

=item corresponding (number, write-only)

This "virtual" attribute is a convenience, which causes the object
to be configured for "corresponding-cell" Sudoku. The topology is
the same as 'set L<sudoku|/item_sudoku>', but in addition corresponding
cells in the small squares must have different values. The extra set
names are "u0", "u1", and so on.

This kind of puzzle is also called "disjoint groups."

=item cube (string, write-only)

This "virtual" attribute is a convenience, which causes the object to
be configured for cubical sudoku. The string is either a number, or
'full', or 'half'.

* a number sets the topology to a Dion cube of the given order.
That is,

 sudokug> set cube 3

generates a 9 x 9 x 9 Dion cube, with the small squares being 3 x 3.
The problem is entered in plane, row, and column order, as though you
were entering the required number of normal Sudoku puzzles
back-to-back.

* 'full' generates a topology that includes all faces of the cube. The
sets are the faces of the cube, and the rows, columns, and (for lack
of a better word) planes of cells that circle the cube.

To enter the problem, imagine the cube unfolded to make a Latin cross.
Then, enter the problem in order by faces, rows, and columns, top to
bottom and left to right. The order of entry is actually by cell
number, as given below.

               +-------------+
               |  0  1  2  3 |
               |  4  5  6  7 |
               |  8  9 10 11 |
               | 12 13 14 15 |
 +-------------+-------------+-------------+
 | 16 17 18 19 | 32 33 34 35 | 48 49 50 51 |
 | 20 21 22 23 | 36 37 38 39 | 52 53 54 55 |
 | 24 25 26 27 | 40 41 42 43 | 56 57 58 59 |
 | 28 29 30 31 | 44 45 46 47 | 60 61 62 63 |
 +-------------+-------------+-------------+
               | 64 65 66 67 |
               | 68 69 70 71 |
               | 72 73 74 75 |
               | 76 77 78 79 |
               +-------------+
               | 80 81 82 83 |
               | 84 85 86 87 |
               | 88 89 90 91 |
               | 92 93 94 95 |
               +-------------+

The solution will be displayed in order by cell number, with line
breaks controlled by the L<columns|/item_columns> attribute, just
like any other solution presented by this package.

I have seen such puzzles presented with the bottom square placed to the
right and rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees. You will need to perform
the opposite rotation when you enter the problem.

* 'half' generates a topology that looks like an isometric view of a
cube, with the puzzle on the visible faces. The faces are divided in
half, since the set size here is 8, not 16. Imagine the isometric
unfolded to make an L-shape. Then, enter the problem in order by faces,
rows, and columns, top to bottom and left to right. The order of entry
is actually in order by cell number, as given below.

 +-------------------+
 |  0    1    2    3 |
 |                   |
 |  4    5    6    7 |
 +-------------------+
 |  8    9   10   11 |
 |                   |
 | 12   13   14   15 |
 +---------+---------+-------------------+
 | 16   17 | 18   19 | 32   33   34   35 |
 |         |         |                   |
 | 20   21 | 22   23 | 36   37   38   39 |
 |         |         +-------------------+
 | 24   25 | 26   27 | 40   41   42   43 |
 |         |         |                   |
 | 28   29 | 30   31 | 44   45   46   47 |
 +---------+---------+-------------------+

The solution will be displayed in order by cell number, with line
breaks controlled by the L<columns|/item_columns> attribute, just
like any other solution presented by this package.

For the 'full' and 'half' cube puzzles, the L</columns> attribute is
set to 4, and the L<symbols|/item_symbols> attribute to the numbers 1
to the size of the largest set (16 for the full cube, 8 for the half
or isometric cube). I have seen full cube puzzles done with hex digits
0 to F; these are handled most easily by setting the
L<symbols|/item_symbols> attribute appropriately:

 $su->set (cube => 'full', symbols => <<eod);
 . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
 eod

=item debug (number)

This attribute, if not 0, causes debugging information to be displayed.
Values other than 0 are not supported, in the sense that the author
makes no commitment what will happen when a non-zero value is set, and
further reserves the right to change this behavior without notice of
any sort, and without documenting the changes.

=item generation_limit (number)

This attribute governs how hard the generate() method tries to generate
a problem. If generate() cannot generate a problem after this number of
tries, it gives up.

The default is 30.

=item iteration_limit (number)

This attribute governs how hard the solution() method tries to solve
a problem. An iteration is an attempt to use the backtrack constraint.
Since what this really counts is the number of times we place a
backtrack constraint on the stack, not the number of values generated
from that constraint, I suspect 10 to 20 is reasonable for a "normal"
sudoku problem.

The default is 0, which imposes no limit.

=item largest_set (number, read-only)

This read-only attribute returns the size of the largest set defined by
the current topology.

=item latin (number, write-only)

This "virtual" attribute is a convenience, which causes the object to
be configured to handle a Latin square. The value gives the size of
the square. Setting this modifies the following "real" attributes:

 columns is set to the size of the square;
 symbols is set to "." and the letters "A", "B",
   and so on, up to the size of the square;
 topology is set to represent the rows and columns
   of a square, with row sets named "r0", "r1",
   and so on, and the column sets named "c0",
   "c1", and so on.

=item max_tuple (number)

This attribute represents the maximum-sized tuple to consider for the
tuple constraint. It is possible that one might want to modify this
upward for large puzzles, or downward for small ones.

The default is 4, meaning that the solution considers doubles, triples,
and quads only.

=item name (string)

This attribute is for information, and is not used by the class.

=item null (string, write-only)

This "virtual" attribute is a convenience, which causes the object to
be configured with the given number of cells, but no topology. The
topology must be added later using the add_set method once for each
set of cells to be created.
The value must be either a comma-separated list of one to three numbers
(e.g. '81,9,9') or a reference to a list containing one to three
numbers (e.g. [81, 9, 9]). The first (and only required) number gives the
number of cells. The second, if supplied, sets the 'columns' attribute,
and the third, if supplied, sets the 'rows' attribute.

value set must be either a comma-separated list of three numbers (e.g.
'3,2,6') or a reference to a list containing three numbers (e.g. [3, 2,
6]). Either way, the numbers represent the horizontal dimension of the
rectangle (in columns), the vertical dimension of the rectangle (in
rows), and the overall size of the puzzle square. For example,

 $su->set (null => [36, 6]);
 $su->add_set (r0 => 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
 $su->add_set (r1 => 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11);
 ...
 $su->add_set (c0 => 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30);
 $su->add_set (c1 => 1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31);
 ...
 $su->add_set (s0 => 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8);
 $su->add_set (s1 => 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11);
 ...

Generates the topology equivalent to

 $su->set (brick => [3, 2, 6])

=item output_delimiter (string)

This attribute specifies the delimiter to be used between cell values
on output. The default is a single space.

=item quincunx (text, write-only)

This "virtual" attribute is a convenience, which causes the object to be
configured as a quincunx (a. k. a. 'Samurai Sudoku' at
L<http://www.samurai-sudoku.com/>). The value must be
either a comma-separated list of one to two numbers (e.g. '3,1') or a
reference to a list of one to two numbers (e.g. [3, 1]). In either case,
the numbers are the order of the quincunx (3 corresponding to the usual
'Samurai Sudoku' configuration), and the gap between the arms of the
quincunx, in small squares. The gap must be strictly less than the
order, and the same parity (odd or even) as the order. If the gap is not
specified, it defaults to the smallest possible.

To be specific,

 $su->set(quincunx => 3)

is equivalent to

 $su->set(quincunx => [3, 1])

and both specify the 'Samurai Sudoku' configuration.

The actual topology is set up as a square of (2 * order + gap) * order
cells on a side, with the cells in the gap being unused. The sets used
are the same as for sudoku of the same order, but with 'g0' through 'g4'
prepended to their names, with g0 being the top left sudoku grid, g1 the
top right, g2 the middle, g3 the bottom left, and g4 the bottom right.

In the case of the 's' sets, this would result in duplicate sets being
generated in the overlap area, so the 's' set from the higher-numbered
grid is suppressed. For example, in the 'Samurai Sudoku' configuration,
sets g0s8, g1s6, g2s6, and g2s8 contain exactly the same cells as g2s0,
g2s2, g3s2, and g4s0 respectively, so the latter are suppressed, and
only the former appear in the topology.

Problems are specified left-to-right by rows. The cells in the gaps are
unused, and are not specified. For example, the May 2, 2008 'Samurai
Sudoku' problem could be specified as

 . . .  . . 1  . . .         . . .  4 . .  . . .
 . . .  . 3 .  6 . .         . . 7  . 2 .  . . .
 . . .  7 . .  . 5 .         . 4 .  . . 5  . . .

 . . 6  9 . .  . . 7         6 . .  . . 9  1 . .
 . 5 .  . 2 .  . 4 .         . 2 .  . 5 .  . 9 .
 4 . .  . . 5  2 . .         . . 8  1 . .  . . 7

               . 4 .  . 6 .  . 2 .
               6 . 7  8 . 9  4 . 1
               . 1 .  . 4 .  . 3 .

 . . .  . . 4  . . .         . . .  2 . .  . . .


Setting this attribute causes the rows and columns attributes to be set
to (2 * order + gap) * order. The symbols attribute is set to '.' and
the numbers 1, 2, ... up to order * order.

=item rows (number)

This attribute defines the number of lines of output to present before
inserting a blank line (for readability) when formatting the topology
attribute, or the solution to a puzzle.

=item status_text (text, read-only)

This attribute is a short piece of text corresponding to the
status_value.

=item status_value (number)

The solution() method sets a status, which can be retrieved via this
attribute. The retrieved value is one of

    SUDOKU_SUCCESS
      This means what you think it does.
    SUDOKU_NO_SOLUTION
      This means the method exhausted all possible
      soltions without finding one
    SUDOKU_TOO_HARD
      This means the iteration_limit attribute was
      set to a positive number and the solution()
      method hit the limit without finding a solution.

=item sudoku (number, write-only)

This attribute is a convenience, which causes the object to be
configured to handle a standard Sudoku square. The value gives the size
of the small squares into which the big square is divided. The big
square's side is the square of the value.

For example, the customary Sudoku topology is set by

 $su->set (sudoku => 3);

This attribute is implemented in terms of 'set brick', and modifies the
same "real" attributes. See L<brick|/item_brick> for the details.

=item sudokux (number, write-only)

This attribute is a convenience. It is similar to the 'sudoku'
attribute, but the topology includes both main diagonals (set names
'd0' and 'd1') in addition to the standard sets. See
L<brick|/item_brick> for the details, since that's ultimately how this
attribute is implemented.

=item symbols (string)

This attribute defines the symbols to be used in the puzzle. Any
printing characters may be used except ",". Multi-character symbols
are supported. The value of the attribute is a whitespace-delimited
list of the symbols, though the whitespace is optional if all symbols
(and symbol constraints if any) are a single character. See the
L<problem()|/item_problem> documentation for full details.

The first symbol in the list is the one that represents an empty cell.
Except for this, the order of the symbols is immaterial.

The symbols defined here are used only for input or output. It is
perfectly legitimate to set symbols, call the problem() method, and
then change the symbols. The solution() method will return solutions
in the new symbol set. I have no idea why you would want to do this.

=item topology (string)

This attribute defines the topology of the puzzle, in terms of what
sets each cell belongs to. Each cell is defined in terms of a
comma-delimited list of the names of the sets it belongs to, and
the string is a whitespace-delimited list of cell definitions. For
example, a three-by-three grid with diagonals can be defined as
follows in terms of sets r1, r2, and r3 for the rows, c1, c2, and
c3 for the columns, and d1 and d2 for the diagonals:

 r1,c1,d1 r1,c2       r1,c3,d2
 r2,c1    r2,c2,d1,d2 r2,c3
 r3,c1,d2 r3,c2       r3,c3,d1

The parser treats line breaks as whitespace. That is to say, the
above definition would be the same if it were all on one line.

You do not need to define the sets themselves anywhere. The
package defines each set as it encounters it in the topology
definition.

For certain topologies (e.g. the London Times Quincunx) it may be
convenient to include in the definition cells that are not part of the
puzzle. Such unused cells are defined by specifying just a comma,
without any set names.

Setting the topology invalidates any currently-set-up problem.

=item $su = Games::Sudoku::General->new ()

This method instantiates a new Games::Sudoku::General object. Any
arguments are passed to the set() method. If, after processing
the arguments, the object does not have a topology,

  $self->set (sudoku => 3)

is called. If there is no symbols setting (which could happen
if the user passed an explicit topology),

  $self->set (symbols => join ' ', '.',
    1 .. $self->get ('largest_set'))

is called. If, after all this, there is still no columns setting,
the number of columns is set to the number of symbols, excluding
the "empty cell" symbol.

The newly-instantiated object is returned.

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, @args) = @_;
    ref $class and $class = ref $class;
    my $self = bless {

}

=item $su->add_set ($name => $cell ...)

This method adds to the current topology a new set with the given name,
and consisting of the given cells. The set name must not already
exist, but the cells must already exist. In other words, you can't
modify an existing set with this method, nor can you add new cells.

=item %constraints_used = $su->constraints_used;

This method returns a hash containing the constraints used in the most
recent call to solution(), and the number of times each was used. The
constraint codes are the same as for the steps() method. If called in
scalar context it returns a string representing the constraints used
at least once, in canonical order (i.e. in the order documented in the
steps() method).

B<Note:> As of version 0.002, the string returned by the scalar has
spaces delimiting the constraint names. They were not delimited in
version 0.001

=item $problem = $su->generate ($min, $max, $const);

This method generates a problem and returns it.

The $min argument is the minimum number of givens in the puzzle. You
may (and probably will) get more. The default is the number of cells
in the puzzle divided by the number of sets a cell belongs to.

The value of this argument is critical to getting a puzzle: too large
and you generate puzzles with no solution; too small and you spend all
your time backtracking. There is no science behind the default, just an
attempt to make a rational heuristic based on the number of degrees of
freedom and the observation that about a third of the cells are given
in a typical Sudoku puzzle. My experience with the default is:

 topology        comment
 brick 3,2,6     default is OK
 corresponding 3 default is OK
 cube 3          default is too large
 cube half       default is OK
 cube full       default is OK
 quincunx 3      default is too large
 sudoku 3        default is OK
 sudoku 4        default is OK
 sudokux 3       default is OK

Typically when I take the defaults I get a puzzle in anywhere from
a few seconds (most of the listed topologies) to a couple minutes
(sudoku 4) on an 800 Mhz G4. But I have never successfully generated
a Dion cube (cube 3). C<Caveat user.>

The $max argument is the maximum number of givens in the puzzle. You
may get less. The default is 1.5 times the minimum.

The $const argument specifies the constraints to be used in the
generated puzzle. This may be specified either as a string or as a hash
reference. If specified as a string, it is a whitespace-delimited list,
with each constraint name possibly followed by an equals sign and a
number to specify that that constraint can be used only a certain
number of times. For example, 'F N ?=1' specifies a puzzle to be
solved by use of any number of applications of the F and N constraints,
and at most one guessed cell. If specified as a hash reference, the
keys are the constraint names, and the values are the usage counts,
with undef meaning no limit. The hash reference corresponding to
'F N ?=1' is {F => undef, N => undef, '?' => 1}. The default for this
argument is to allow all known constraints except '?'.

In practice, the generator usually generates puzzles solvable using
only the F constraint, or the F and N constraints.

The algorithm used is to generate a puzzle with the minimum number of
cells selected at random, and then solve it. If a solution does not
exist, we try again until we have tried
L<generation_limit|/item_generation_limit> times, then we return undef.
B<This means generate() is not guaranteed to generate a puzzle.>

If we get a solution, we remove allowed constraints. If we run into
a constraint that is not allowed, we either stop (if we're below the
maximum number of givens) or turn it into a given value (if we're
above the maximum). We stop unconditionally if we get down to the
minimum number of givens. As a side effect, the generated puzzle is
set up as a problem.

Note that if you allow guesses you may get puzzles with more than
one solution.

=item $su->problem ($string);

This method specifies the problem to be solved, and sets the object
up to solve the problem.

The problem is specified by a whitespace-delimited list of the symbols
contained by each cell. You can format the puzzle definition into a
square grid (e.g. the SYNOPSIS section), but to the parser a  line
break is no different than spaces. If you pass an empty string, an
empty problem will be set up - that is, one in which all cells are
empty.

An exception will be thrown if:

 * The puzzle definition uses an unknown symbol;
 * The puzzle definition has a different number
   of cells from the topology definition;
 * There exists a set with more members than the
   number of symbols, excluding the "empty"
   symbol.

The whitespace delimiter is optional, provided that all symbol names
are exactly one character long, B<and> that you have not defined any
symbol constraint names more than one character long since the last
time you set the symbol names.

This method returns the steps taken to solve the problem. If no
solution was found, it returns the steps taken to determine this. If
called in list context, you get an actual copy of the list. The first
element is the name of the constraint applied:

 F = forced: only one value works in this cell;
 N = numeration or necessary: this is the only cell
     that can supply the given value;
 B = box claim: if a candidate number appears in only
     one row or column of a given box, it can be
     eliminated as a candidate in that row or column
     but outside that box;
 T = tuple, which is a generalization of the concept
     pair, triple, and so on. These come in two
     varieties for a given size of the tuple N:
   naked: N cells contain among them N values, so
     no cells outside the tuple can supply those
     values.
   hidden: N cells contain N values which do not
     occur outside those cells, so any other values
     in the tuple are supressed.
 ? = no constraint: generated in backtrack mode.

See L<http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/sudoku/> and
L<http://www.angusj.com/sudoku/hints.php> for fuller
definitions of the constraints and how they are applied.

The second value is the cell number, as defined by the topology
setting. For the 'sudoku' and 'latin' settings, the cells are
numbered from zero, row-by-row. If you did your own topology, the
first cell you defined is 0, the second is 1, and so on.

The third value is the value assigned to the cell. If returned in
list context, it is the number assigned to the cell's symbol. If
in scalar context, it is the symbol itself.

#	T constraint - "tuple" (double, triple, quad). These come in
#	two flavors, "naked" and "hidden". Considering only pairs for
#	the moment:
#   A "naked pair" is two cells in the same set which contain the same
#	pair of possibilities, and only those possibilities. These
#	possibilities are then excluded from other cells in the set.
#   A "hidden pair" is when there is a pair of values which can only
#	be contributed to the set by one or the other of a pair of
#	cells. These cells then must supply these values, and any other
#	values supplied by cells in the pair can be eliminated.
#    For higher groups (triples, quads ...) the rules generalize, except
#	that all of the candidate values need not be present in all of
#	the cells under consideration; it is only necessary that none
#	of the candidate values appears outside the cells under
#	consideration.
#
#	Glenn Fowler of AT&T (http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/sudoku/)

=head1 EXECUTABLES

The distribution for this module also contains the script 'sudokug',
which is a command-driven interface to this module.

=head1 CLIPBOARD SUPPORT

Clipboard support is highly OS-specific. Here is the story by OS - or,
really, by the contents of $^O:

=head2 cygwin

Under cygwin, we first try to load the Win32::Clipboard module. If this
succeeds, we use it. If not, we try to use the xclip program, available
from L<http://freshmeat.net/project/xclip>.

=head2 darwin

Under Darwin, also known as Mac OS X, we use the pbcopy programs to
copy text to the clipboard, and pbpaste to retrieve text from the
clipboard. These programs are supposed to come with Mac OS X. If pbcopy
or pbpaste (depending on what we are trying to do) is not found, we try
xclip, under the assumption that you are running Darwin without the Mac
OS X overlay. The xclip program is available from
L<http://freshmeat.net/project/xclip>.

=head2 MacOS

Under MacOS (meaning OS 9 or below) we currently have no way to put
text onto the clipboard.

=head2 MSWin32

Under Windows, we use Win32::Clipboard if available.

=head2 Anything else

Under any other operating system, we try to use the xclip program,
available from L<http://freshmeat.net/project/xclip>.

=head1 BUGS

The X, Y, and W constraints (to use Glenn Fowler's terminology) are
not yet handled. The package can solve puzzles that need these
constraints, but it does so by backtracking.

Please report bugs either through L<http://rt.cpan.org/> or by
mail to the author.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The author would like to acknowledge the following, without whom this
module would not exist:

provided the methodological starting point and basic terminology, whose
'sudoku' executable provided a reference implementation for checking
the solutions of standard Sudoku puzzles, and whose constraint taxonomy
data set provided invaluable test data.

Angus Johnson, whose fulsome explanation at
L<http://www.angusj.com/sudoku/hints.php> was a great help
in understanding the mechanics of solving Sudoku puzzles.

L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Games-Sudoku-OO/>) also solves the
standard 9x9 version of the puzzle, with an option to solve (to the
extent possible) a single row, column, or square. The implementation may
be extensible to other topologies than the standard one.

The C<Games-Sudoku-Solver> package by Fritz Mehner (see
L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Games-Sudoku-Solver/>) solves 9x9 Sudoku
puzzles by recursion and backtracking.

The C<Games-Sudoku-SudokuTk> package by Christian Guine (see
L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Games-Sudoku-SudokuTk/> claims to
implement a Tk-based Sudoku solver.

The C<Games-YASudoku> package by Andrew Wyllie (see
L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Games-YASudoku/>) also solves the standard
9x9 version of the puzzle. In contrast to the other packages, this one
represents the board as a list of cell/value pairs.

#	Guide to attributes:
#  The following indicators say how each attribute is used:
#    T - The attribute is used to define the topology. It is set by
#        set (topology => string).
#    A - The attribute is set by some setting other than topology.
#    P - The attribute is used to define the problem. It is set by
#        problem();
#    S - The attribute is used to solve the problem.
#
#  T {cell} = []		# A list of the cell definitions.
#  P {cell}[$inx]{content}	# The symbol the cell contains.
#  T {cell}[$inx]{index} = $inx	# The index number of the cell.
#  T {cell}[$inx]{membership} = [] # A list of the names of the sets
#				   # the cell is a member of.
#  P {cell}[$inx]{possible} = {}   # A list of the possible values of
#				   # the cell. Each element is false if
#				   # the value is possible.
#  P {cells_unassigned}		# Number of empty cells remaining
#  T {cells_unused}		# Number of cells which are not members
#				# of any set.
#  S {constraints_used} = {}	# The number of times each constraint
#				# was applied.
#  T {intersection}{$name} = []	# The indices of the cells in the named
#				# intersection. The name is the alpha-
#				# betized set names, comma-separated.
#  T {largest_set}		# The size of the largest set.
#  S {no_more_solutions}	# Cleared when problem set up, set when
#				# we run out of backtrack.
#  T {set} = {}			# A hash of all the set definitions.
#  T {set}{$set}{content} = []	# The contents of the set.
#  T {set}{$set}{membership} = []  # A list of the numbers of the cells
#				   # that are members of the set.
#  T {set}{$set}{name} = $set	# The name of the set.
#  A {allowed_symbols}{$name} = [] # The list contains a 1 if the
#				# symbol's value is allowed under the
#				# named symbol set.
#  A {biggest_spec}		# Number of characters in biggest
#				# symbol or allowed value set name.
#  A {biggest_symbol}		# Number of characters in biggest
#				# symbol.
#  A {symbol_hash} = {}		# A hash of symbols, giving the internal
#				# value for each.
#  A {symbol_list} = []		# A list of the symbols used, in order
#				# by the values used internally.
#  A {symbol_number}		# Number of symbols defined.
